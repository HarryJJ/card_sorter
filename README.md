# Card Sorting Algorithms

This Python script demonstrates various sorting algorithms applied to a deck of playing cards. Each card is represented by a tuple containing a `Rank` and a `Suit` from corresponding enums.

## Introduction

The script simulates the sorting of a standard deck of playing cards, where each card has a rank (e.g., Ace, King, Queen, etc.) and a suit (e.g., Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades). The deck is initially shuffled, and then various sorting algorithms are applied to sort the deck.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. The script will print the original shuffled deck of cards, then apply different sorting algorithms and print the sorted deck along with the elapsed time for each algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in the script:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each sorting algorithm is applied to the shuffled deck of cards, and the sorted deck is printed along with the time taken for sorting.
